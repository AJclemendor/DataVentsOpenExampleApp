# Using the Example UI

Pages:

- `/search` — unified search across providers. Adjust provider, sort, and status filters. Results show normalized events; expand an event to view sub‑markets.
- WebSocket panel (header) — open the “DV WS” panel to send a subscribe message and watch live normalized events.

Tips:

- Hover or click markets to open a modal with a lightweight price chart and a simple top‑of‑book view.
- The right sidebar keeps a local history of requests and WS sessions (stored in IndexedDB).
